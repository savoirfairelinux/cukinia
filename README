= Project objectives

Cukinia works if it offers the following value:

* Is very simple to use
* Require no dependencies other than busybox
* Helps developers creating better software

= Base config

The base configuration looks like that:

<pre>
# Include additional conf snippets
cukinia_conf_include /etc/cukinia_/conf.d/*.conf

# Run additional tests
cukinia_run_dir /etc/cukinia_/tests.d/*

# Run additional tests with multiple test folders
cukinia_run_dirs folder_0 folder_1 folder_n
</pre>

= Adding a test from a package

Scenario: you're writing a Buildroot package ('myapp'), and would like
to add a few tests for it.

First, let's add a few tests that cukinia can provide:
- user 'appuser' exists
- process 'myapp' is running
- process 'myapp' is running with user 'myuser'
- python package 'mypkg' is present
- http request 'www.mypage.com'

/etc/cukinia/conf.d/myapp.conf:

<pre>
# ensure user 'appuser' exists
cukinia_user appuser

# process 'myapp'
cukinia_process myapp

# process 'myapp' with user 'myuser'
cukinia_process myapp myuser

# python package 'mypkg'
cukinia_python_pkg mypkg

# http request 'www.mypage.com'
cukinia_http_request www.mypage.com
</pre>
