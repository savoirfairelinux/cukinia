Zucchini firmware validation framework.

= Project objectives

ZFVF works if it offers the following value:

* Is very simple to use
* Require no dependencies other than busybox
* Helps developers creating better software

= Base config

The base configuration looks like that:

<pre>
# Include additional conf snippets
zucchini_conf_include /etc/zucchini/conf.d/*.conf

# Run additional tests
zucchinif_run_dir /etc/zucchini/tests.d/*

# Run additional tests with multiple test folders
zucchinif_run_dirs folder_0 folder_1 folder_n
</pre>

= Adding a test from a package

Scenario: you're writing a Buildroot package ('myapp'), and would like
to add a few tests for it.

First, let's add a few tests that zucchini can provide:
- user 'appuser' exists
- process 'myapp' is running
- process 'myapp' is running with user 'myuser'
- python package 'mypkg' is present

/etc/zucchini/conf.d/myapp.conf:

<pre>
# ensure user 'appuser' exists
zucchini_user appuser

# process 'myapp'
zucchini_process myapp

# process 'myapp' with user 'myuser'
zucchini_process myapp myuser

# python package 'mypkg'
zucchini_python_pkg mypkg
</pre>
